          <h1>Shopping Cart</h1>
          <p>I developed a Java-based GUI shopping cart application that simulates an online store experience. The program reads a list of items from a file, allows users to add items to their cart by entering an item ID, and generates a receipt upon checkout. To ensure accountability, every transaction is recorded in a transaction file for documentation and review.</p>
          <h2>Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>GUI Interface: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly shopping experience.</li>
            <li>Item Lookup: Reads product data from a file and matches items by their unique IDs.</li>
            <li>Shopping Cart Management: Users can add items to their cart and view their selections in real time.</li>
            <li>Checkout & Receipt: Automatically generates and displays a receipt with item details and totals.</li>
            <li>Transaction Logging: All purchases are written to a transaction file for record-keeping.</li>
            <li>Bulk Discounts: Automatically applies discounts when items are purchased in bulk.</li>
          </ul>>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>File Handling: Ensuring that inventory and transaction files were read and written correctly without data corruption.</li>
            <li>Error Handling: Managing invalid inputs, such as incorrect item IDs or empty carts.</li>
            <li>GUI Responsiveness: Designing a layout that remained clear and functional as the cart updated in real time.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
